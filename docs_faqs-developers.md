# Developers

**I am a third party app developer or integration developer. I want to
develop an app/integration using ServiceTitan's APIs. How can I get
started?**

Please visit the Request Access tab and fill out the form. Once your
details are received one of our team members will review your
information, if required get in touch with you. Finally you will get
access to an integration environment where you can get started. 

**As an existing or potential developer will I get access to the
integration environment?**

Yes, all developers will get access to one instance of the integration
environment which all of the users in your organization can share. 

**As a developer which environments will I have access ? What data will
I have access to in the integration environment?**

As a developer you will have access to an integration environment with
standard demo data  for your app development and testing activities. 

**Will my app key generated in integration environment work for making
calls in production on behalf of the customer?**

The App key you generate in the integration environment is not
environment specific and works when you make calls to access customer
resources in production as well. 

You will need to obtain the Client ID & Secret Key in the integration or
production environment accordingly from the ServiceTitan customers who
intend to use your app.
