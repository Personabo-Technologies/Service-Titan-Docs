# Payroll APIs

**Payroll**

ServiceTitan offers a variety of ways to track and manage employee
payroll; for both timesheet and performance pay. Employees have the
ability to punch in and out of both job and non-job events in
ServiceTitan, which determines the number of hours they have worked.
There is also the ability to incentivize employees through bonuses,
commissions, and spiffs which ServiceTitan helps automate.

[Timesheet codes]{.underline}---Non-job related events that a company
can create in order to keep track of employee non-productive time.
Examples include meetings, shop time, and training.

[Activity codes, or earning codes]{.underline}---A way for companies to
aggregate and consolidate all of  their employees gross earnings in
ServiceTitan to match the earning codes of a third party payroll
processor. Assigning earnings codes to earnings aids in exporting and
importing data from ServiceTitan to your payroll processor.

[Job split]{.underline}---When multiple technicians are assigned to a
job, the job split determines what percent of the revenue, bonus/spiff
each technician receives.

[Payroll adjustments]{.underline}---Provide a way for companies to
manually create earnings inside ServiceTitan.

[Payroll periods]{.underline}---Define when the company pay period
starts and ends. This drives the overtime calculation for hourly
employees and provides a quick way of pulling gross earnings for
employees in a given payroll period.

[Gross pay items]{.underline}---Itemized earnings for all employees.
They include all paid time events as well as any bonuses, commissions,
and adjustments
