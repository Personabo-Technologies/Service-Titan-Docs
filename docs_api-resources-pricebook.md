# Pricebook APIs

ServiceTitan's Pricebook stores services and materials used to complete
a job. Technicians use Price book to create estimates faster by using
pre-populated services, materials and prices rather than creating
estimates from scratch each time.

[Services]{.underline}---Services are what technicians are doing while
on a job. For example, replacing a capacitor or installing an emergency
valve.

[Materials]{.underline}---Materials are the items used by a technician
to complete a service. So in the previous example the materials would be
the capacitor and the emergency valve.

[Equipment]{.underline}---Equipment are large ticket items that are
installed. The install dates are usually tracked for replacement
opportunities. Examples of equipment are condensers or furnaces.  

[Categories]{.underline}---You can organize your pricebook by
categories. Each service, material, and piece of equipment should be
given a category so the technician can easily find items.    

When a business offers a new service, a service item is added to their
pricebook. If there are materials needed to complete the service,
material items are created also. Once both the service and material have
been added, you can link them together. Linking a material to a service
improves consistency - every technician knows what materials they should
use when performing a service and helps track inventory. The cost of the
material is used to calculate the service price when leveraging
ServiceTitan's pricing features. 

High level use cases for these APIs:

-   Get a list of Pricebook items 

-   Add, modify or delete any Pricebook items\
