# V1 API Sunset

**When are the V1 APIs sunsetting ?**

V1 APIs will sunset by the end of July 2022. Please plan to migrate from
existing V1 APIs to V2 APIs by July 2022 . 

**I use the Data backup API to get .bak file. Will this be impacted too
?**

No. Data backup API (which gives you .bak file as a data dump for your
data lake) will not be sunsetting by the end of July 2022. You will
continue to have access to generate .bak file without any impact.

**What happens if I don\'t migrate to V2 APIs by the end of July 2022
?**

If you do not migrate to V2 APIs by end of July 2022 your connectivity
will break and your data access will be impacted. Hence we request you
to complete your migration to V2 APIs by the end of July 2022.
