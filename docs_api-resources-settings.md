# Settings API

**Employees:**

Employees are Non-Managed Technicians who use ServiceTitan (users of
ServiceTitan). Typically this includes roles like CSR, Dispatcher and
Bookkeeper.

High- level use cases for these APIs:

GET Employee contact information (email or phone)

GET All "active" Employees

GET Validate/Search for an Employee with a specific "name"

**Technicians:**

Technicians are employees who work in the field and leverage
ServiceTitan on a daily basis using either the web based interface or
more commonly the ServiceTitan Mobile Application. 

High- level use cases for these APIs:

GET Technician contact information (email, phone, or address)

GET Technician goal information

GET Technician ID

GET All "managed" Technicians

GET Validate/Search for a Technician with a specific "name"

**Business Units:**

In ServiceTitan, a business unit is generally a division within your
business. For example, if you run a business that has multiple
departments, such as install and sales, classify each department as a
unit in ServiceTitan. When there's revenue or tasks completed for each,
you can track performance separately in reports. After you set up all
your business units, you can track and report on them. If you have
multiple locations, you can assign business units to those, too.

High- level use cases for these APIs:

GET Business Unit contact information (email, phone, or address)

GET Tenant information (Tenant ID)

GET Authorization Paragraph

GET Acknowledgement Paragraph

**Tag Types: **

Adding tags helps you flag anything from customers, jobs, and locations,
easily highlighting key items when using your ServiceTitan account to
run your business. You can also add tags to identify customer membership
types, types of equipment they have, and supplies needed for a job
associated with a job for a customer. When creating tags, keep them
short and sweet! This will make it easier for you and your team to
identify them. Tag names should be 30 characters or less.

High- level use cases for these APIs:

GET a list of all Tags (and IDs)

**User Roles: **

User Provisioning APIs will allow to create Employee and Technician,
Edit Employee and Technician and change the status between
active/deactivated from external systems (e.g. HRIS)
