# Marketing APIs

**Campaigns**

The Campaigns feature in ServiceTitan tracks marketing performance
across all channels. A campaign is the primary method of revenue to a
particular marketing effort. Users can create new campaigns, maintain
existing campaigns, and review analysis to better understand marketing
effectiveness, gauge return-on-investment, and make informed decisions
about future marketing spend. Campaigns can be tracked by using unique
phone numbers. Once a call hits a phone number associated with a
campaign, the call is attributed to that campaign.
