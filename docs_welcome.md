# Welcome

At ServiceTitan, we value our developers and strive to provide the best
developer experience. With this in mind, we aim to get you onboarded
quickly, offer resources to reduce your development costs and speed your
time to market, unlocking value quickly for your business. 

The ServiceTitan developer portal is where you can discover ServiceTitan
APIs, learn how to use them, test them, and manage your application
keys.

\
**Supported users:** Our infrastructure is designed to serve these
organization types:\

-   ServiceTitan Customers (a.k.a Tenants)

    -   Businesses that have at least one ServiceTitan account and
        leverage the ServiceTitan suite for running all or some
        functions of their business. We assume these customers build
        private applications leveraging ServiceTitan APIs which is used
        within the organization. They have their own software
        engineering resources to successfully complete API
        integrations. \

-   Developers

    -   Integration developers build integrations to ServiceTitan APIs,
        increasing the breadth of the ServiceTitan platform and feature
        set. 

    -   App developers build public apps and want to market their apps
        to ServiceTitan's customers. We recommend these developers to
        establish a relationship with ServiceTitan before integrating to
        ServiceTitan APIs by filling the form requesting access.
