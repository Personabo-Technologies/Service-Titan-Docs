# Going live

After completing your development, testing and pre production activities
in the integration environment, we recommend you to go live by switching
to production.

[To switch to production]{.underline}:

1.  Continue to use your application key generated for the integration
    or production environments.

2.  Replace the Client ID & Secret Key used for the integration with the
    pair generated in production environment instance of the
    ServiceTitan app.Â 

3.  Call the production API endpoint URLs.\
