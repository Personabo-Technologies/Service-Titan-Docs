# Equipment Systems APIs

**Installed Equipment**

Installed equipment is equipment that has been sold and installed at a
location. A record of the equipment is stored in ServiceTitan to allow
users to track details about the equipment. A ServiceTitan user can
either sell and then install equipment to create a record of it or
manually add equipment to a location record. Users can link forms,
services, and memberships to equipment in order to create a complete
history of the work that has been done.Â 

High level use cases for these APIs:

-   Get all equipment at a specific location

-   Retrieve information about specific equipment that has been
    installed

-   Update information about specific equipment that has been installed

-   Create a record of installed equipment at a location\
